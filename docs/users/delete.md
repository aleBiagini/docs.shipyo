## Important Notes

### Soft Delete Behavior
- This is a **soft delete** - the user record is not permanently removed
- User is marked as deleted/inactive in the database
- User will no longer be able to login
- User data is preserved for audit and compliance purposes
- Deleted users may still appear in historical reports

### Permission Requirements
- **SuperAdmin**: Can delete any user (except themselves)
- **Admin**: Can delete users within their tenant (except themselves)  
- **User**: Cannot delete any users

### Business Rules
- Users cannot delete their own account (prevents accidental lockout)
- Some systems may prevent deletion of users with active orders/data
- Deleted users may need to be reactivated rather than recreated

### Alternative Actions
If you need to:
- **Temporarily disable**: Use the [Update User](/users/update) endpoint to set `isActive: false`
- **Change permissions**: Use the [Update User](/users/update) endpoint to change `roleId`
- **Transfer ownership**: Contact system administrator

## Recovery
If a user was deleted by mistake:
1. Contact your system administrator
2. User can potentially be reactivated through database operations
3. Consider using the `isActive` flag instead of deletion for temporary restrictions
