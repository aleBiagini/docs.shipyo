## Critical Warnings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Impact of Tenant Deletion

**This operation affects:**
- All users within the tenant (they lose access)
- All tenant-specific data and configurations  
- All API keys associated with the tenant
- All tenant-specific integrations and settings
- Historical data and reports (may become inaccessible)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Soft Delete Behavior
- Tenant is marked as deleted, not permanently removed
- Data is preserved for compliance and audit purposes
- Users cannot login or access tenant resources
- Tenant may still appear in some administrative reports
- Deleted tenant ID cannot be reused for new tenants

## Pre-Deletion Checklist

Before deleting a tenant, ensure:

1. **‚úÖ Backup Data**: Export critical tenant data
2. **‚úÖ Notify Users**: Inform all tenant users about the deletion
3. **‚úÖ Transfer Data**: Move important data to other systems if needed
4. **‚úÖ Cancel Integrations**: Disable webhooks, API integrations, etc.
5. **‚úÖ Handle Billing**: Process final billing and cancel subscriptions
6. **‚úÖ Document Reason**: Record why the tenant is being deleted

## Permission Requirements

### SuperAdmin Only
- Only SuperAdmin users can delete tenants
- This prevents accidental or unauthorized tenant deletion
- Requires the highest level of system access

### Multi-Step Verification (Recommended)
Many systems implement additional safeguards:
- Confirmation dialog with tenant name
- Email verification to SuperAdmin
- Audit trail with deletion reason
- Cooling-off period before actual deletion

## Alternative Actions

Consider these alternatives before deletion:

### Temporary Deactivation
```bash
# Use Update Tenant to deactivate instead
curl -X PUT https://shipyo.it/api/Tenant/update \
  -H "x-api-key: your-key" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id": 1, "name": "Tenant Name", "isActive": false}'
```

### Data Archival
- Export tenant data before deletion
- Store in archive system for compliance
- Maintain data access for legal requirements

### User Migration
- Transfer users to other tenants
- Preserve user accounts and data
- Maintain service continuity

## Recovery Process

If a tenant was deleted by mistake:

1. **Immediate Action**: Contact system administrator
2. **Data Recovery**: Tenant data may be recoverable from soft delete
3. **Reactivation**: May require database-level operations
4. **Testing**: Verify all tenant functionality after recovery

## Compliance Considerations

- Some industries require data retention periods
- Legal requirements may prevent permanent data deletion
- Audit trails must be maintained for deleted tenants
- Consider GDPR and other privacy regulations

## Monitoring and Alerts

- Tenant deletion should trigger alerts to administrators
- Log all deletion attempts and their outcomes
- Monitor for unauthorized deletion attempts
- Track tenant lifecycle for compliance reporting
